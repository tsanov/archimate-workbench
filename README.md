# Nik's ArchiMate Workbench

## In a nutshell

This repo is part of distributed [collaboration platform](https://sara-sabr.github.io/ITStrategy/2021/07/09/working-in-the-open-part-2.html) and contains unclassied ArchiMate views I am personally involved with, contributed through [Archi&coArchi](https://www.archimatetool.com/plugins/). 

The notion of Archimate Workbench is defined in [section 11.4 of Enterprise Architecture at Work](https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783662539323). 

Anyone could use or contribute to the artefacts in this repo in accordance with [Working in the Open: Part 2](https://sara-sabr.github.io/ITStrategy/2021/07/09/working-in-the-open-part-2.html)

Any questions, judgement or comments would be welcome at nikolay.tsanov at hrsdc-rhdcc.gc.ca.

## How it works

Currently there are [GCCode mirror](https://gccode.ssc-spc.gc.ca/tsanov/archimate-workbench) and [GitHub mirror](https://github.com/tsanov/archimate-workbench) of this repo: they are meant to be identical and you're most likely reading either one of them or a clone. 

Everyone can submit merge (GCCode terminology) and pull requests (GitHub terminology) to any of mirrors. The mirrors are synced regularly but should you need your contributions to be synced sooner than later please let me know.

The HTML export of all the views in this repo is available at this [GitHub Static Page](https://github.com/tsanov/).
