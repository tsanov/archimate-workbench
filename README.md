## How it works

Currently there are GCCode mirror and GitHub mirror of this repo. Everyone can submit merge (GCCode terminology) and pull requests (GitHub terminology) to any of them. The mirrors are synced regularly but should you need your contributions to be synced sooner than later please let me know.
