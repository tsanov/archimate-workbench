    documentation="A repository for slowly changing operational master data (information assets) such as, customer profiles, product definitions, and contracts. This repository provides authoritative operational master data for the real-time interfaces, real-time analytics and for data validation in data ingestion. If it is a reference repository of the operational master data management (MDM) systems it might also be extended with new attributes that are maintained by the reservoir. When this hub is taking data from more than one operational system, there may also be additional quality and de-duplication processes running that improve the data. These changes are published from the asset hub for distribution both inside and outside the reservoir."/>
