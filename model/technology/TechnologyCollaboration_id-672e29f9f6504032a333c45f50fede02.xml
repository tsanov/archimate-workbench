    documentation="A repository holding a copy of most of the data in the data reservoir. It provides a place where raw data can be located for analysis. The data may be annotated, linked, and consolidated in deep data. Data may be mapped to data structures after it is stored, so effort is spend as needed rather than at the time of storing. This repository is designed for flexibility, supporting both high volumes and variety of data"/>
