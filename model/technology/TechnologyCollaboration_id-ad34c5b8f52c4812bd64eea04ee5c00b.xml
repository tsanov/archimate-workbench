    documentation="Self-service provisioning helps to get information to business users with minimal delay, known characteristics, and without any additional IT involvement. To support this and improve the usefulness of the reservoir, users are able to request access to additional data and feedback on the data within the reservoir through comments, tagging, rating, and other collaboration. This can be done through interfaces such as the catalog as they search for data, or through other collaboration tools and social media. Information views provide simplified subsets of the data reservoir repositories that are labeled with business friendly terms."/>
