    documentation="Data scientists usually have a solid foundation in computer science, mathematics, and statistics, rather than substantial business knowledge. Their role is to explore different kinds of data to look at patterns so that they can understand the meaning of relationships between sets of data. They often have a thirst for new information sources to develop new ideas on how to gain value from combining that data with other sources. The tools used by the data scientists include capabilities for preparing and transforming data for analysis. They typically work with data in its original (raw) format. Data can be accessed through the creation of a sandbox copy of the data for the data scientist to use because the data scientist will subset and transform the data as part of their work. Their activity should not affect the shared version of the data in the data reservoir. The sandbox will be accessible as an area in a file system such as Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) or accessible by using common mechanisms such as Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) or Open Database Connectivity (ODBC). As the data scientists explore samples of this data, they will develop analytical models and try them out against test data. Those models can then be deployed to refinery services within the data reservoir or to operational systems outside the data reservoir."/>
