    documentation="Workflow consists of a server running stewardship processes that coordinate the work of the individuals responsible for fixing any problems with the data in the data reservoir. Successful use of a data reservoir depends on various processes involving systems, users, and administrators. For example, provisioning new data into the data reservoir might involve an information curator defining the catalog entry to describe and classify the data. An information owner must approve the classifications, and an integration developer must create the data ingestion process. Workflow coordinates the work of these people."/>
