Publishing feeds are responsible for distributing data from within the data reservoir to other systems external to the reservoir. This can include other analytical systems, other data reservoirs, and systems of record, but all are outside the governance control of the supplying data reservoir. Lineage for the publishing process is captured, but this might be the furthest point lineage reports are available to. This data can be triggered by upstream changes, or run on a schedule or on demand from a user request. A subscription table is used to manage the list of sources and the destinations they need to be published to. The destinations can involve populating a table, creating files, or messages to be posted to a queue. During the publishing process, data transformation can occur, for example by resolving code values to alternate representations."/>
